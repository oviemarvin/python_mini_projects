# python_mini_projects

This repository contains my 100 Days of Python journey, starting with small but practical beginner projects.  
Each project is organized by week and includes the concepts I practiced.  

 Notes
- These are beginner-friendly projects to help me practice fundamentals.  
- Iâ€™ll keep adding projects week by week as part of my learning journey.  

Feedback and suggestions are welcome! Part of my CS50/NIIT learning challenge.
